about everything in \texttt{Main} class.\\

Based on Naive Bayes algorithm (multinomial model)
\cite[Chapter 13, figure 13.2]{irbook}

Conditional probabilities are computed based on train set (350 nonspam messages
and 350 spam messages), which give as prior probabilies:\\

$ P(\texttt{ns}) = \frac{350}{700} = 0.5 $
and 
$ P(\texttt{s}) = \frac{350}{700} = 0.5 $.\\

Conditional probabilities for every token computes by dictionaries of doc, with
multiplication on token frequency (actually it's equals computations by tokens,
\textit{but I already conduct dictionaries for each doc}).

After that evaluates on test sets with 130 nonspam messages and 130 spam
messages. As soon as we use logarithm normalization on probability values $\in (0..1)$,
thus all scores are negative.




\paragraph*{Applying on \texttt{ns} test set}

Within 130 nonspam messages 7 was wrongly classified as spam:\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
  docID & spam & nonspam \\
  \hline
  6-380msg1.txt & -1204.08 & -1241.75 \\
  6-453msg1.txt & -108.18 & -109.31 \\
  6-437msg3.txt & -1486.73 & -1546.93 \\
  6-890msg3.txt & -1745.23 & -1753.74 \\
  6-790msg1.txt & -2711.84 & -2797.29 \\
  6-809msg3.txt & -2226.56 & -2365.50 \\
  6-781msg5.txt & -455.77 & -457.09 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

ACCURACY - 0.9461538
\end{center}

\paragraph*{Applying on \texttt{s} test set}
And almost all spam messages was properly classified.
Except one:\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
  docID & spam & nonspam \\
  \hline
  spmsga125.txt & -1268.22 & -1258.18 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

ACCURACY - 0.99230766
\end{center}
